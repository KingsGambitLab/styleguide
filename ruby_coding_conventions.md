### InterviewBit Ruby Coding Conventions

We will strictly follow [The Ruby Style Guide](https://rubystyle.guide/) for our Backend Code. It might be possible we deviate from it a bit but leads will make sure that it has been documented properly.

**Tip**: Rubocop is based on the same guide, please use it to its full extent.
