## InterviewBit Style Guide

Every major project has its own style guide: a set of conventions (sometimes arbitrary) about how to write code for that project. It is much easier to understand a large codebase when all the code in it is in a consistent style.

“Style” covers a lot of ground, from “use camelCase for variable names” to “never use global variables” to “never use exceptions.”

This project currently holds only one guide which is

* [A Guideline to open an effective Pull Request](https://github.com/KingsGambitLab/styleguide/blob/master/pull_request_guideline.md)
* [Ruby Coding Conventions](https://github.com/KingsGambitLab/styleguide/blob/master/ruby_coding_conventions.md)
